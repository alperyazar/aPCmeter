# Firmware Folder
This folder contains Arduino firmware and code documentation.

## Sub folders and files

* *aPCmeter/aPCmeter.ino*: Arduino sketch file. It is the source code. For this moment, it is tested using Arduino Software 1.6.7.
*  *aPCmeter/aPCmeter.pdf*: Documentation of Arduino firmware. It is generated by Doxygen 1.8.11.
*  *doxygen*: This folder contains necessary file for Doxygen documentation. LaTeX (pdflatex) should be installed on the system to generate aPCmeter.pdf file. 

*C:16396*

***Note to myself:*** After generating new doxygen documentation, all output files are generated on \_doxygen_out folder. This folder is ignored by Git. Final output (refman.pdf) should be coppied as aPCmeter/aPCmeter.pdf.

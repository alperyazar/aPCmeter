# Wood Folder

This folder contains necessary design files to cut wood plates. As stated in `howtobuild.html` in `HowToBuild*`this a very basic template. You should improvise to build a complete box. I used wood an ordinary wood plate with thickness 0.25cm.

## Files

* `pcmeter_wood_simple_cutting.xml`: I used a software called **simple-cutting-software-x.exe 2016.01.17.0 trial version** to find optimum layout for wood cut. Trial version was sufficient for me. You can downlad it from [http://www.nesting-technologies.com/simple-cutting-software-x-en.html](http://www.nesting-technologies.com/simple-cutting-software-x-en.html). This is the project file.

* `WoodCuttingLayout.png`:  This is the layout optimized by the software. Wood thickness is taken as 0.25cm.

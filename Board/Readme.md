# Board Folder

This folder includes circuit schematic and necessary hardware files.

Circuit schematic and layout is drawn using Fritzing 0.9.2.

## Files

* `aPCmeter_sch.fzz`: Fritzing project file containing schematic and breadboard layout.
* `aPCmeter_sch_bb.[pdf png svg]`: An example breadboard layout generated using Fritzing.
* `aPCmeter_sch_bom.html`: Auto generated BOM file from Fritzing. It is given as reference, please don't consider tolerance etc. vales, just use  values.
* `aPCmeter_sch_schem.pdf`: Schematic of the hardware drawn in Fritzing.
* `nano_pinout.pdf`: Pinout of Arduino Nano 3 given as reference.

***Note to myself:*** aPCmeter_sch_bom.html contains full path of project file. Don't forget to delete it.
